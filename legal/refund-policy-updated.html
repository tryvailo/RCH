                    <p>We're committed to your satisfaction. If you're not completely happy with your care home assessment report, we'll refund your payment in full within 30 days of purchase.</p>

            <h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
            <p>At RightCareHome, we stand behind the quality of our care home assessment services. We understand that choosing a care home is one of the most important decisions you'll make, and we want you to feel confident in using our service.</p>

            <h2>Who Is Eligible for a Refund?</h2>
            <p>You are eligible for a full refund if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You request a refund within <strong>30 days</strong> of your initial payment</li>
                <li>You have received your assessment report (we need to understand what didn't meet your expectations)</li>
                <li>You can provide specific feedback about why the service didn't meet your needs</li>

            <h2>Exceptions to Our Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>Refunds may not be provided in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Requests made more than <strong>30 days</strong> after purchase</li>
                <li>If you've used our service to successfully place a loved one in a care home and are simply dissatisfied with that home (our service provides recommendations, not guarantees about individual homes)</li>
                <li>If you violated our <a href="/legal/terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a></li>
                <li>If you've disputed the payment through your bank or card issuer before contacting us (this creates administrative complications)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Partial Refunds</h2>
            <p>In certain cases, we may offer a partial refund. This typically applies when you've received substantial value from our service but had specific issues with certain aspects. Partial refunds are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>

            <h2>Chargebacks and Disputes</h2>
            <p>We strongly encourage you to contact us directly before initiating a chargeback through your bank. Chargebacks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take longer to resolve than our refund process</li>
                <li>May result in additional fees for you</li>
                <li>Prevent us from understanding and addressing your concerns</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you initiate a chargeback, we will provide your bank with evidence of the services provided and this refund policy.</p>

            <h2>Free Services and Lead Magnets</h2>
            <p>Our free services (such as free care home shortlists, guides, and checklists) are provided without charge and are not subject to refunds. However, if you're dissatisfied with these free resources, please let us know so we can improve them.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Refund Policy from time to time. Changes will not affect refund requests for purchases made before the policy was updated. The "Last Updated" date at the top indicates when the policy was last revised.</p>

            <h2>Your Rights Under UK Law</h2>
            <p>This refund policy is in addition to your statutory rights under UK consumer law, including the Consumer Rights Act 2015. Nothing in this policy affects those rights.
